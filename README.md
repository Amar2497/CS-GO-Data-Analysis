# 🎮 CS:GO Player Performance Analysis – Data-Driven Insights into Esports  

![CSGO Analysis Banner](/content/images/performance_chart.png)  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) professional player data** to explore **performance trends, player ranking changes, and competitive insights**.  

As my first **game data analytics** project, I have used **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib** to extract meaningful insights.  

### 🔥 **Key Questions Answered:**  
- 📊 **Who are the top-performing players based on Kills Per Round (KPR)?**  
- 🔄 **How does Deaths Per Round (DPR) vary among players?**  
- 🎯 **What are the statistical distributions of key performance metrics?**  
- 📈 **How do players' performances trend over time? (Future analysis)**

## 📂 Dataset Information  
- **Source:** Kaggle (CS:GO Pro Players Dataset)  
- **Size:** Approx. `XX MB`, contains statistics on professional CS:GO players  
- **Features Used:**
  - `Player`: Name of the player  
  - `KPR`: Kills Per Round (Main metric for player efficiency)  
  - `DPR`: Deaths Per Round (Risk factor metric)  
  - `Rounds Played`: Total rounds played  
  - `HLTV Rating`: Overall player ranking  
  - `Headshot %`: Accuracy and aiming efficiency  

📌 *More columns will be used in extended analysis (see future work section below).*

## 📊 Data Analysis & Insights  

### **1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Checked for missing values** & cleaned the dataset  
- **Basic statistics computed** for KPR, DPR, and other key metrics  
- **Visualized distributions** to understand player performance  

### **2️⃣ Key Statistics**
- **Average Kills Per Round:** `0.69`  
- **Average Deaths Per Round:** `0.67`  
- **Player with the highest KPR:** `sh1ro`  

### **3️⃣ Data Visualization**
📊 **Performance Distribution of Players**  
A histogram comparing KPR & DPR across all players.
